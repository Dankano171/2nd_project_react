Hello Mr Hosen.

To figure out and fix the bug, I have started by understanding the SignIn/SignUp engineering and core features,I summarize my findings below;

   The NFT marketplace employs a sophisticated dual-authentication architecture that maintains completely
 separate login systems for sellers and users operating in parallel. The system is built around a token-based authentication flow using JWT tokens that are stored in the browser's localStorage and automatically included in all API requests through axios interceptors. When a user attempts to sign up or sign in, the frontend detects whether they are a seller or regular user and routes them to the appropriate authentication endpoints(—sellers to /api/seller endpoints and users to /api/user endpoints), with each having distinct database models, to ken types, and protected routes.

The authentication process begins with credential validation where the backend verifies email formats and checks for existing users before hashing passwords with bcrypt for secure storage. Upon successful authentication, the backend generates a JWT token containing the user's ID and returns it along with basic profile information to the frontend. The React application then stores this token in localStorage and updates the corresponding authentication (context—either sellerAuthContext or userAuthContext) which manages the authentication state including whether the user is authenticated, their profile data, and any error messages.

What makes this architecture particularly robust is its persistence mechanism—on initial app load, the system automatically checks localStorage for existing tokens and attempts to validate them with the backend, effectively creating an auto-login feature that maintains user sessions across browser refreshes. The route protection system uses higher-order components that consult the authentication contexts before rendering protected routes, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page while allowing authenticated users access to their respective dashboards. This entire flow is secured through multiple layers including password hashing, token signing with secret keys, and both client-side and server-side input validation, creating a seamless yet secure authentication experience that supports the marketplace's multi-role user base without compromising security or user experience.
   By understanding these architecture,I can now start finding out what causes the undefined error.
 Please kindly comment (about the SignIn/signUp architecture),a little information from you might help figured it out.
